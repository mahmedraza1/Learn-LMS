## Security Considerations

### Authentication Flow Updates
The authentication system now implements a strict admission-based access control:

1. **Guest Users**: Must log in at learn.pk
2. **Students**: Must have verified admission status (`admission_status: 'Granted'`)
3. **Admins/Instructors**: Full access with administrative privileges

### Breaking Changes in v2.0.0
- **Admission Status Requirement**: Students without granted admission can no longer access LMS
- **Auto-redirect Behavior**: Unauthorized users are automatically redirected
- **Date Field Removal**: Components no longer display or save date information
- **Redux State Structure**: Authentication state management completely rewritten

### Migration Guide
For existing installations:

1. **Update WordPress API**: Ensure `/wp-json/custom/v1/me` returns `admission_status` field
2. **Student Access**: Verify all students have proper admission status in WordPress
3. **Component Updates**: Remove any custom date handling code
4. **Redux Integration**: Update any custom state management to use new Redux structure

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed legacy date restrictions that prevented flexible lecture scheduling
- Cleaned up authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- Improved mobile responsiveness across all components
- Standardized error handling and user feedback
