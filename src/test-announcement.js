// Test file to verify the announcements functionality

// Import dependencies
import { LectureProvider, useLecture } from '../src/contexts/LectureContext';

// Sample test data
const testAnnouncement = {
  title: "Important Update",
  content: "This is a test announcement content",
};

// Sample course data
const course = {
  id: "course1",
  title: "Test Course",
  batch: "Batch A",
};

// This file contains test scenarios for the announcement features:
// 1. Adding a new announcement
// 2. Editing an existing announcement 
// 3. Deleting an announcement
// 4. Displaying announcements in the UI

/*
Testing Strategy:

1. Create a new announcement:
   - Call addAnnouncement with course ID and announcement data
   - Verify announcement appears in the course's announcements list
   - Check if the API endpoint /api/announcements/:batch/:courseId was called

2. Update an existing announcement:
   - Call updateAnnouncement with course ID, announcement ID and updated data
   - Verify announcement was updated with the new data
   - Check if the API endpoint /api/announcements/:batch/:courseId was called with the correct data

3. Delete an announcement:
   - Call deleteAnnouncement with course ID and announcement ID
   - Verify announcement was removed from the course's announcements list
   - Check if the API endpoint /api/announcements/:batch/:courseId/:announcementId was called

4. Display announcements:
   - Render CourseCard component with course data
   - Verify announcements are displayed correctly
   - Verify admin controls are shown only to admin users
*/

// Example usage of the announcement functions:
// 
// // Add a new announcement
// const newAnnouncement = await addAnnouncement(course.id, testAnnouncement);
// 
// // Update an existing announcement
// const updatedAnnouncement = await updateAnnouncement(
//   course.id,
//   newAnnouncement.id,
//   { ...testAnnouncement, title: "Updated Title" }
// );
// 
// // Delete an announcement
// await deleteAnnouncement(course.id, newAnnouncement.id);
