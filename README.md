## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mahmedraza1/Learn-LMS.git
   cd Learn-LMS
   ```

2. Install all dependencies (frontend and backend):
   ```
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```
   npm install                        # Install frontend dependencies
   cd server && npm install && cd ..  # Install backend dependencies
   ```

3. Start both frontend and backend:
   ```
   npm run dev:all
   ```
   
   Or start them separately:
   ```
   # Terminal 1 - Frontend
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Backend
   npm run server
   ```

4. Access the frontend at [https://lectures.learn.pk:5173](https://lectures.learn.pk:5173)
5. Backend API runs at:
   - Production: [https://lms.learn.pk/learnlive](https://lms.learn.pk/learnlive)
   - Development: [http://localhost:3001/learnlive](http://localhost:3001/learnlive)

### Production Mode

To build the frontend and serve it from the backend:

```
npm run start
```

This will:
1. Build the frontend into the `dist` folder
2. Start the Express server which will serve both:
   - API endpoints at `/learnlive/*`
   - Frontend static files from the `dist` directory

Access the complete application at:

### üîç Debugging

To debug authentication issues:

1. **Check Console Logs**: AuthWrapper logs all authentication state
2. **Verify API Response**: Check `/wp-json/custom/v1/me` endpoint
3. **Admission Status**: Ensure `admission_status` field is `'Granted'`
4. **Role Verification**: Confirm user has correct roles in WordPress

Example debug output:
```javascript
AuthWrapper Debug: {
  user: { id: 123, roles: ['student'], admission_status: 'Granted' },
  isAdmin: false,
  isStudent: true,
  isGuest: false,
  hasGrantedAdmission: true,
  loading: false,
  admission_status: 'Granted'
}
```
